## TODO: gdb basic usage example
Set up a bazel c++ project in `demo/basic/`. Use a hand of function calls, so that it is not too simple, but avoid complex logic, I want students to understand the project in five minutes. Teach students to use gdb.

Write full teaching material in `gdb-notes/1-gdb-basic.md`, guiding students step by step.

## TODO: coredump teaching example

Set up a bazel c++ project in `demo/crash/`. One binary load a `.so` library. Some funcs in the library will crash, and produce coredump. Use a hand of function calls, so that it is not too simple, but avoid complex logic, I want students to understand the project in five minutes. Then teach the students use `gdb` to load coredump and find why the crash happened.
